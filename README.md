## User Guide

The user guide is divided into the following two sections:

- **Quick Start**

  This section is intended for beginners who are just getting started with RT-Thread. By following simple steps, you can run the RT-Thread operating system on this development board and observe the experimental results.

- **Advanced Usage**

  This section is intended for developers who need to use more board resources on the RT-Thread operating system. By using the FSP and RT-Thread Settings tools to configure the project, more on-board resources can be enabled to achieve advanced functionality.

### Quick Start

This BSP currently provides an RT-Thread Studio project. Below, we use the RT-Thread Studio development environment as an example to illustrate how to get the system running.

**Create a Project**

- Download the **Titan Board SDK** resource package.

![image-20251031110044228](figures/image-20251031110044228.png)

* Download the compilation toolchain and debugging tools.

![image-20251031110119279](figures/image-20251031110119279.png)

- Create a new RT-Thread project.

![image-20251031110700267](figures/image-20251031110700267.png)

**Hardware Connection**

Use a USB cable to connect the development board to the PC, and use the DAP-Link interface to download and debug the program.

**Build and Download**

![image-20250819172013186](figures/image-20250819172013186.png)

**View Running Results**

After the program is successfully downloaded, the system will automatically run and print system information.

Connect the development board’s corresponding serial port to the PC, open the corresponding serial port in a terminal tool (115200-8-1-N), and reset the device. You will then see the RT-Thread output information. Enter the `help` command to view the commands supported in the system.

**Application Entry Function**

The entry function of the application layer is located in **src\hal_entry.c** within `void hal_entry(void)`. User-created source files can be placed directly in the **src** directory.

```c
void hal_entry(void)
{
    rt_kprintf("\n==================================================\n");
    rt_kprintf("Hello, Titan Board!\n");
    rt_kprintf("==================================================\n");

    while (1)
    {
        rt_pin_write(LED_PIN_0, PIN_HIGH);
        rt_thread_mdelay(1000);
        rt_pin_write(LED_PIN_0, PIN_LOW);
        rt_thread_mdelay(1000);
    }
}
```

**FSP Configuration**

If you need to modify the Renesas BSP peripheral configuration or add new peripheral interfaces, you will need to use the Renesas [Flexible Software Package (FSP)](https://www.renesas.cn/zh/software-tool/flexible-software-package-fsp?queryID=c20a16b5f7f3866713b62c7acb07f2fc) configuration tool. Please make sure to follow the steps below for configuration. If you encounter any issues, you may ask questions in the [RT-Thread Community Forum](https://club.rt-thread.org/).

1. [Download Flexible Software Package (FSP) | Renesas](https://github.com/renesas/fsp/releases/download/v6.0.0/setup_fsp_v6_0_0_rasc_v2025-04.1.exe), please use **FSP version 6.0.0**
2. Refer to the documentation: [Configuring Peripheral Drivers Using FSP for the RA Series](https://www.rt-thread.org/document/site/#/rt-thread-version/rt-thread-standard/tutorial/make-bsp/renesas-ra/RA系列使用FSP配置外设驱动?id=ra系列使用-fsp-配置外设驱动).

- **Method 1: Configure development by importing FSP:**

Users can locate the `configuration.xml` file in the project and import it into FSP to start configuration:

Select **File → Open** at the top-left corner to open the configuration file.

![image-20251030163423452](figures/image-20251030163423452.png)

- **Method 2: Configure FSP using built-in commands in RT-Thread Studio:**

After installing RA-FSP, first create a **Titan Board** project in Studio. Under the project, you will see the built-in Renesas FSP configuration option: **RA Smart Configurator**.

Double-click this option, then locate the root directory where RA-FSP was installed, and set this directory as the FSP installation path.
